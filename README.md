# my-os

I started writing this operating system sometime last century back in high school.  It was a way to play around with assembly language and low level programming. As I recall, I was able to get it to the point of protected mode + paging + context switching.  

Then it got pushed to the very back burner and has been rotting away since then.  Rather than keeping it in the depths of my hard drives forever, I've decided to put it up here for someone ( but probably no one ) to see.
